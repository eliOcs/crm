# Plan
1. Polish the app + landing page → Makes it feel real, helps with IT approval later
2. Test integration with dummy Exchange → Proves technical feasibility without needing company approval yet
3. Get verified → Now you have a real-looking app to back it up
4. Approach company IT → Come with a polished, verified app

You can get a free Microsoft 365 developer account (E5 sandbox) for testing:
- 25 user licenses, 90 days renewable
- Full Exchange Online access
- Perfect for testing Graph API integration
