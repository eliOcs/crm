# Design Style:
- **Modern Fintech / Clean B2B:** This is the specific niche. It prioritizes trust and clarity.
- **Swiss Style / International Typographic Style:** It leans heavily on this design history—grids, sans-serif typography, and high readability.
- **Flat Design 2.0:** It is mostly flat but uses subtle borders and very soft colors to distinguish areas, rather than heavy shadows or gradients.

# Visual Traits:
- **Pastel Data Visualization:** Notice the charts aren't neon; they are soft salmon, beige, and muted orange. This reduces cognitive load.
- **High Whitespace:** The layout breathes. There is significant padding around the "Exercise early" and "Wait till IPO" columns.
- **"Pill" Shapes:** The buttons  are fully rounded.
- **Split-Screen Layout:** Inputs on the left, live visual output on the right.
