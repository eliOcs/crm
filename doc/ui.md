# Design Style:
- **Modern Fintech / Clean B2B:** Prioritizes trust and clarity.
- **Swiss Style / International Typographic Style:** It leans heavily on this design history—grids, sans-serif typography, and high readability.
- **Flat Design 2.0:** It is mostly flat but uses subtle borders and very soft colors to distinguish areas, rather than heavy shadows or gradients.

# Visual Traits:
- **Blue-Grey Palette:** Primary color derived from the logo (#4D6B7D blue-grey). Accent colors are soft beige and muted orange. This creates a professional, trustworthy feel.
- **High Whitespace:** The layout breathes. There is significant padding.
- **"Pill" Shapes:** The buttons are fully rounded.
